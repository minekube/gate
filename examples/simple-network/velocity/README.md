# Velocity test server

This is a minimal config for testing velocity support on 1.18. It **does not**
contain a server jar and you need to download one yourself https://papermc.io/downloads#Paper-1.18.
This config is known to work with [paper-1.18.1-148.jar](https://papermc.io/api/v2/projects/paper/versions/1.18.1/builds/148/downloads/paper-1.18.1-148.jar),
though any version of paper which supports modern velocity should work.

You need to connect to it with `gate --config config-velocity.yml` in the parent directory.
