- **Spoofing**: There is a risk of attackers impersonating legitimate players to gain access to the server.
- **Tampering**: Game data could be altered in transit, affecting game integrity.
- **Repudiation**: Players might deny actions they have performed within the game, necessitating a reliable state
  machine.
- **Information Disclosure**: Exposure of sensitive information, such as player IP addresses, could lead to privacy
  breaches.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The proxy service could be targeted with excessive traffic, aiming to disrupt its
  availability.
- **Elevation of Privilege**: There is a potential for attackers to gain unauthorized access to administrative functions
  or elevated privileges.

## Implemented Cybersecurity Measures

To address the identified threats, that Minekube Gate has implemented a range of controls:

- **Encryption**: Use of AES in CFB-8 mode encryption to encrypt data in transit, preventing eavesdropping and MitM
  attacks. ([ref](https://github.com/minekube/gate/blob/0b3b733dc3bdede11873fce5f52704ef2ec519cf/pkg/edition/java/proto/codec/cipher.go#L57))
    - The implementation utilizes the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode with an 8-bit
      shift register, commonly referred to as CFB-8. AES is a symmetric key encryption algorithm, which means the same
      key is used for both encryption and decryption. CFB-8 is a mode of operation that allows block ciphers like AES to
      function as stream ciphers, processing data in smaller incrementsâ€”in this case, 8 bits or 1 byte at a time.
    - This mode is particularly useful for encrypting data streams where the data's length may not be a multiple of the
      block size and where data needs to be processed byte-by-byte as it arrives. The CFB-8 mode achieves
      confidentiality by XORing each byte of the plaintext with an 8-bit segment of the encrypted previous ciphertext
      block (or the initialization vector for the first block). The initialization vector (IV) is a critical component
      that must be unique and unpredictable for each encryption session to ensure the security of the encryption scheme.

- **Rate Limiting and Quota Management**: Implementation of rate limiting to protect against DoS and DDoS attacks, and
  quota management to control the number of requests from a single source. (
  refs: [pkg](https://github.com/minekube/gate/blob/0b3b733dc3bdede11873fce5f52704ef2ec519cf/pkg/internal/addrquota/quota.go#L10), [connecting](https://github.com/minekube/gate/blob/0b3b733dc3bdede11873fce5f52704ef2ec519cf/pkg/edition/java/proxy/proxy.go#L476), [login](https://github.com/minekube/gate/blob/0b3b733dc3bdede11873fce5f52704ef2ec519cf/pkg/edition/java/proxy/session_handshake.go#L138))
    - The system enforces a consistent rate limit for events per second, allowing a specified number of requests from an
      IP address before imposing restrictions. This is crucial for mitigating the risk of service disruption due to
      excessive traffic from individual sources, which could be indicative of a DoS or DDoS attack.
    - A burst capacity is included to accommodate legitimate spikes in traffic, ensuring that users are not unduly
      restricted by the rate limiting mechanism during periods of high but legitimate usage.
    - The use of an LRU cache for storing rate limiters per IP address ensures efficient memory usage by retaining only
      the most recently accessed limiters, automatically purging the least active ones when the cache reaches its
      maximum capacity. This approach balances the need for active quota management with system resource constraints.
    - By grouping IP addresses with similar low-order bytes, the system can manage quotas for a range of IPs, reducing
      the granularity of control but improving performance and memory usage. This trade-off is often acceptable in
      scenarios where strict per-IP rate limiting is not required.

- **Authentication**: Ensuring secure client verification for online mode
  connections. ([ref](https://github.com/minekube/gate/blob/0b3b733dc3bdede11873fce5f52704ef2ec519cf/pkg/edition/java/auth/authenticator.go#L28))
    - The server employs RSA encryption to safeguard the exchange of sensitive data during the authentication process,
      crucial for preventing unauthorized access and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    - A server ID is generated using the decrypted shared secret and the server's public key, which, along with the
      player's username and optional IP address, is used to authenticate with Mojang's session server.
    - Rate limiting is implemented to protect against brute-force attacks and to prevent excessive requests to Mojang's
      API, which is an essential measure for maintaining the server's integrity and compliance with usage policies.
