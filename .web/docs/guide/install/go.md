# Install using Go

If you have [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
and [Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
you can install Gate using the `go install` command:

```sh console
go install go.minekube.com/gate@latest
```

## Go Run

Using Go you could even run Gate without the installation command.
Internally Go downloads and caches the module, builds and caches the compiled object files
and finally runs it, all at once.
```sh console
go run go.minekube.com/gate@latest
```

Thanks to local caching running this command a second time would start Gate even quicker
since all the required dependencies are already on the local machine.
