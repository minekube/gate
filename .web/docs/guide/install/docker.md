# Running Gate in Docker

_Gate ships in packaged Docker images that you can use to run Gate containers or base your own images on. You can also
run it in [Kubernetes](kubernetes)._

## Version Tags

You can use specific version tags instead of the latest. Every commit to the `main` branch is built and pushed to
the `latest` tag as well as the commit's short SHA
like [`6d3671c`](https://github.com/minekube/gate/pkgs/container/gate/50952923?tag=6d3671c).

## Image Variants

Gate provides two Docker image variants:

### Standard Image (`ghcr.io/minekube/gate:latest`)

The standard Gate image is based on a minimal distroless base image. This is the recommended image for most use cases as it has a smaller footprint and enhanced security.

### JRE Variant (`ghcr.io/minekube/gate/jre:latest`)

The JRE variant includes Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and is **required for [Bedrock Edition support](../bedrock)**. This image is based on `eclipse-temurin:25-jre-alpine` and includes Java necessary to run Geyser for Bedrock cross-play.

::: tip When to Use the JRE Variant
Use `ghcr.io/minekube/gate/jre:latest` if you:
- Need [Bedrock Edition support](../bedrock) (cross-play with mobile, console, and Windows Bedrock players)
- Are using Gate's managed Geyser mode
- Require Java runtime in your container

For all other use cases, use the standard `ghcr.io/minekube/gate:latest` image.
:::

## `docker run`

```sh console
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/minekube/gate:latest
```

This command will pull and run the latest Gate image.

- `-it` - Run interactively and allocate a pseudo-TTY.
  - Alternatively using `-d` would run in detached mode.
- `--rm` - Removes the container after it exits.

### Mounting a config file

A complete config is located in repo [config.yml](https://github.com/minekube/gate/blob/master/config.yml).

:::: code-group

```sh [Standard Image]
docker run -it --rm \
  -v PATH-TO-CONFIG/config.yml:/config.yml \
  ghcr.io/minekube/gate:latest
```

```sh [JRE Variant (Bedrock Support)]
docker run -it --rm \
  -v PATH-TO-CONFIG/config.yml:/config.yml \
  ghcr.io/minekube/gate/jre:latest
```

::::

This command will pull and run the latest Gate image.

- `-v PATH-TO-CONFIG/config.yml:/config.yml` - Mounts the config file from the host system into the container.
- Use the **JRE variant** if you need [Bedrock Edition support](../bedrock).

### Mounting a config file and Minekube Connect token

#### Using an environment variable for the token

:::: code-group

```sh [Standard Image]
docker run -it --rm \
  -v PATH-TO-CONFIG/config.yml:/config.yml \
  -e CONNECT_TOKEN=YOUR-TOKEN \
  ghcr.io/minekube/gate:latest
```

```sh [JRE Variant (Bedrock Support)]
docker run -it --rm \
  -v PATH-TO-CONFIG/config.yml:/config.yml \
  -e CONNECT_TOKEN=YOUR-TOKEN \
  ghcr.io/minekube/gate/jre:latest
```

::::

**Note:** The `CONNECT_TOKEN` environment variable takes precedence over the `connect.json` file, so if both are provided, the token from the environment variable will be used instead.

#### Using a volume for the token

:::: code-group

```sh [Standard Image]
docker run -it --rm \
  -v PATH-TO-CONFIG/config.yml:/config.yml \
  -v PATH-TO-CONFIG/connect.json:/connect.json \
  ghcr.io/minekube/gate:latest
```

```sh [JRE Variant (Bedrock Support)]
docker run -it --rm \
  -v PATH-TO-CONFIG/config.yml:/config.yml \
  -v PATH-TO-CONFIG/connect.json:/connect.json \
  ghcr.io/minekube/gate/jre:latest
```

::::

A [Minekube Connect](https://connect.minekube.com/) token json file can be automatically generated by running Gate with `connect.enable: true` in the config.

```json connect.json
{ "token": "YOUR-TOKEN" }
```

## `docker-compose.yaml`

Copy the following snippet into a `docker-compose.yaml` file and run `docker-compose up`.

```yaml docker-compose.yaml
version: '3.9'

services:
  gate:
    image: ghcr.io/minekube/gate:latest
    container_name: gate
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - PATH-TO-CONFIG/config.yml:/config.yml
    #- PATH-TO-TOKEN/connect.json:/connect.json
```

Running `docker-compose down` will stop and remove the containers.

We provide an example that configures Gate with two Minecraft servers.

```sh console
git clone https://github.com/minekube/gate.git
cd gate/.examples/docker-compose
docker-compose up
```

The files of the two servers are located in the `serverdata*` directories.
You can join at `localhost:25565` and use `/server` to switch between the servers.

### Using the JRE Variant for Bedrock Support

If you need [Bedrock Edition support](../bedrock), use the JRE variant image:

```yaml docker-compose.yaml
version: '3.9'

services:
  gate:
    image: ghcr.io/minekube/gate/jre:latest
    container_name: gate
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - PATH-TO-CONFIG/config.yml:/config.yml
```

The JRE variant includes Java Runtime Environment required for Geyser to run. See the [Bedrock Edition guide](../bedrock) for complete Bedrock setup instructions.

## Troubleshooting

If you see the following error:

```sh console
Unable to find image 'ghcr.io/minekube/gate:latest' locally
docker: Error response from daemon: Head "https://ghcr.io/v2/minekube/gate/manifests/latest": denied: denied.
See 'docker run --help'.
```

do

```sh console
docker logout ghcr.io
```

It may be because you are logged in to the GitHub Container Registry with an outdated personal access token (PAT).
Simply logout or login with a new token. It's worse to provide a bad token than not to provide a token at all. GitHub
sets tokens to expire after 30 days by default.
