# Grafana Cloud

[Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/) is a fully managed observability platform that supports OpenTelemetry. Follow these steps to set up Gate with Grafana Cloud:

1. **Create a Grafana Cloud Account**

   - Sign up at [Grafana.com](https://grafana.com/auth/sign-up/create-user)
   - Navigate to your organization
   - Create an Access Policy with write permissions at [Access Policies](https://grafana.com/orgs/your-org/access-policies)
   - Generate and save your API token

2. **Configure Stack**

   Navigate to your Grafana Cloud Stack (e.g., grafana.com/orgs/your-org/stacks/xxxxx) and:

   - Click "Send Traces" in the Tempo section to get your traces endpoint
   - Click "Send Metrics" in the Prometheus section to get your metrics endpoint

3. **Prepare Your Authentication**

   You'll need to encode your credentials in base64 format. Use one of these methods:

   - Using the command line:

     ```bash
     echo "YOUR_INSTANCE_ID:YOUR_API_TOKEN" | base64
     ```

   - Or visit an online base64 encoder like [base64encode.org](https://www.base64encode.org/)

4. **Configure Gate**

   Export the following environment variables before starting Gate:

   ```bash
   # For traces (Tempo)
   export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://tempo-prod-XX-prod-XX-XXXXX.grafana.net/tempo"
   export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Basic YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_CREDENTIALS"

   # For metrics (Prometheus)
   export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL="http/protobuf"
   export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER="otlp"
   export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT="https://prometheus-prod-XX-prod-XX-XXXXX.grafana.net/api/prom/push"
   export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_HEADERS="Authorization=Basic YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_CREDENTIALS"
   ```

   ::: tip
   For production deployments, consider setting these environment variables in your system configuration or container orchestration platform rather than exporting them manually.
   :::

5. **Start Gate**

   Once the environment variables are set, start Gate normally. It will automatically begin sending telemetry data to Grafana Cloud.

   ```bash
   gate
   ```

   See [Install](/guide/install/) for more information on how to start Gate.

6. **View Your Data**

   Log into your Grafana Cloud account and click on the "Launch" button for Grafana:

   - Navigate to the Tempo service to view your traces
   - Navigate to the Prometheus service to view your metrics

   ![Launch](./launch.png)

   - Go to the "Explore" section and select "Tempo" to in the sources

   ![tempo-source](./tempo-source.png)

   ![Trace](./trace.png)

   - Or select "Prometheus" to view your metrics
