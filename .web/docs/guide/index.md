## What is Gate?

Gate is a lightweight yet powerful Minecraft proxy that can run anywhere - from your local machine to large-scale cloud deployments:

- 🚀 Run locally as a simple [binary](install/binaries)
- 🐳 Deploy with [Docker](install/docker) containers
- ☸️ Scale infinitely in [Kubernetes](install/kubernetes) clusters

It's designed as a modern replacement for legacy proxies like BungeeCord, while maintaining compatibility to run alongside them. Built entirely in Go and inspired by the Velocity project, Gate brings enterprise-grade performance to Minecraft server networks.

::: tip Why Go?
Gate is written in [Go](https://go.dev/) - a modern, fast, and reliable programming language designed by Google.

Go powers the world's largest platforms and is used by companies like:
Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Twitter, PayPal, Twitch, Netflix, Dropbox, Uber, Cloudflare, Docker, and many more.

### How It Works

Gate acts as an intelligent middleware between players and your Minecraft servers:

1. Players connect to Gate like a normal Minecraft server
2. Gate forwards connections to your actual game servers (vanilla, Paper, Spigot, etc.)
3. Players can move between servers while maintaining their connection
4. Gate monitors all network traffic and emits events for:
   - Login/Logout
   - Server Connections
   - Chat Messages
   - Player Kicks
   - [And more!](https://github.com/minekube/gate/blob/master/pkg/edition/java/proxy/events.go)

This architecture enables powerful features like load balancing, server maintenance without disconnects, and network-wide plugins.
