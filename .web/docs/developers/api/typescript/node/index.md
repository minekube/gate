You can use the following `.npmrc` to install the dependencies from the `buf.build` registry.

::: code-group

```toml [.npmrc]
<!--@include: ./.npmrc -->
```

:::

or using `pnpm`:

```bash
pnpm config set @buf:registry https://buf.build/gen/npm/v1/
```

To install dependencies:

::: code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @buf/minekube_gate.connectrpc_es@latest
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @buf/minekube_gate.connectrpc_es@latest
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @buf/minekube_gate.connectrpc_es@latest
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @buf/minekube_gate.connectrpc_es@latest
```

:::

Refer to the [ConnectRPC](https://connectrpc.com/docs/node/using-clients) documentation for more information on how to use ConnectRPC with TypeScript on server side.

::: tip Browser support

To use the Gate API in the browser, check out the [Web](/developers/api/typescript/web/) documentation.

:::

::: code-group

```ts [index.js]
<!--@include: ./index.ts -->
```

:::

::: warning

Note that we had to append `.js` to the import path in line 3 due Node.js requiring `.js` for CommonJS modules, other than in [Bun](/developers/api/typescript/bun/).

```ts
import { GateService } from '@buf/minekube_gate.connectrpc_es/minekube/gate/v1/gate_service_connect.js';
```
