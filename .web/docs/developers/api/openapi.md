# OpenAPI Reference

The Gate API is fully documented using OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification. This provides a machine-readable description of the API that can be used to generate client libraries, interactive documentation, and testing tools.

::: warning Type-Safe Client Libraries

**We provide official, type-safe client libraries** for multiple programming languages. These are the recommended way to interact with the Gate API as they provide compile-time type safety, better error handling, and are automatically kept in sync with API changes.
