# Events

_Gate provides a powerful event system that allows you to listen to and modify events that occur in the proxy._

## Subscribing to Events

Events are a way to communicate between different parts between your code and Gate.
They are a way to decouple Gate from your own application code and make it more flexible.

Checkout the [Simple Proxy](examples/simple-proxy#code) for more examples.

Example:
```go
<!--@include: subscribe_example.go -->
```
