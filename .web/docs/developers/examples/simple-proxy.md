# Simple Proxy â€¢ Example

`Simple Proxy` is a runnable example Go project that showcases all the basic features of Gate.
You can use this project as a template for your own Gate plugins.

## Running the Simple Proxy

```sh console
git clone https://github.com/minekube/gate.git
cd gate/.examples/extend/simple-proxy
go run .
```

## Run any Minecraft backend server

You must run a backend server to actually join the game and see Simple Proxy in action.
Open a new terminal and start a Minecraft server:

```sh console
cd .examples/simple-network/server1
java -jar *.jar -nogui
```

Join the proxy at `localhost:25565`.

## Learning Task

> If you change code in the Simple Proxy project, you must restart the proxy to see the changes.
> (press `CTRL+C` to stop the proxy)

Add a `/playerinfo` command to the proxy that prints the player details like username and play duration.
