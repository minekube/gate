  # Lite mode is a lightweight reverse proxy mode that acts as thin layer between the client and the backend server.
  # It efficiently routes client connections based on the virtual host address received in the handshake packet.
  # This allows to protect multiple backend servers behind a single port Gate Lite proxy instance.
  # Player connections (including ping requests and player authentication) is forwarded to the destined backend server.
  # This means Lite mode supports proxy behind proxy setups, but advanced features like server switching or proxy commands are no longer available
  # and have no effect in Lite mode when extensions use higher level Gate APIs and events.
  lite:
    # Enable Lite mode.
    # If disabled, the proxy will act as a full proxy with all features enabled like just like BungeeCord/Velocity.
    # If enabled, the proxy will act as a lightweight reverse proxy to support new types of deployment architecture.

    enabled: true
    # The routes that the proxy redirects player connections to based on matching the virtual host address.
    # The routes are matched in order of appearance.
    # Examples:
    routes:
      # Match the virtual host address to the backend server.
      - host: localhost
        # The backend server to connect to if matched.
        backend: localhost:25566
      # You can also use * wildcard to match any subdomain.
      - host: '*.example.com'
        backend: 172.16.0.12:25566
        proxyProtocol: true # Use proxy protocol to connect to backend.
        realIP: true # Optionally you can also use TCPShield's RealIP protocol.
      # You can also match to multiple hosts to one or multiple random backends.
      - host: [ 127.0.0.1, localhost]
        backend: [ 172.16.0.12:25566, backend.example.com:25566 ]
      # Match all as last item routes any other host to a default backend.
