# Try Velocity Forwarding Mode

This is a minimal config for testing velocity forwarding mode supported by Gate on a paper server.
It **does not** contain a server jar, and you need to download one yourself https://papermc.io/downloads.

In order to start Gate with the provided config run `gate --config config-velocity.yml` in the parent directory.
