// incapable of receiving these packets during the CONFIG state. Certain events such as the
// ServerPreConnectEvent may be called during this time, and we need to ensure that any API that
// uses these packets will work as expected.
// This handler will queue up any packets that are sent to the client during this time, and send
// them once the client has (re)entered the PLAY state.
