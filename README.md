## Gate Lite Mode

Gate has a Lite Mode which is a lightweight version of Gate that can expose
multiple Minecraft servers through a single port and IP address and reverse proxy
players to backend servers based on the hostname/subdomain they join with.

See the [Lite Mode](https://gate.minekube.com/guide/lite/) guide for more information.
